# Huffman Coding 

Huffman coding is a lossless data encoding algorithm. The process behind the scheme includes sorting numerical values from a set in order of their frequency. The least frequent numbers are gradually eliminated via the Huffman tree, which adds the two lowest frequencies from the sorted list in every new “branch.” The sum is then positioned above the two eliminated lower frequency values, and replaces them in the new sorted list.
